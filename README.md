## About

I made this game to learn Go. This is a very basic application and not optimized (already).
I use [Alec Aivazis's library](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/survey) for menus.

## Installation

1. [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. clone the repo
3. move to the repo
4. run `go build`
5. run `./goMine` and enjoy :)
